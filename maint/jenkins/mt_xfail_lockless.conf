# Conditional XFAIL settings: Additions for the lockless mode of the VCI branch
#
# Syntax (similar to a cron file):
#   [jobname] [compiler] [config] [provider] [direct] [am] [pmix] [sed of XFAIL]
#   Note that the [jobname] allows partial matches (see examples). Other
#   conditions only allows exact matches.
#   The actual allowed combinations are depending on the Jenkins job. For
#   example,
#   per-commit * * opa1x * * sed -i "..."
#   will have no effect since none of the per-commit jobs has opa1x netmod in the
#   configuration.
#
# Examples:
#   nightly gnu debug sockets exclusive noam sed -i "..."
#   This will apply the set the XFAIL when the job is "nightly-ancc" or
#   "nightly", the compiler is "gnu", the jenkins_configure is
#   "debug", provider is "sockets", shm configuration is "exclusive",
#   and force_am configuration is "noam".
#
# Important note:
#   The BSD sed on FreeBSD and OSX nodes has different parameters than the GNU
#   sed. You should use `gsed` than `sed` on them.
#
# For each build, all applied XFAILS will be summarized in
# ${SOURCE}/apply-xfail.sh
