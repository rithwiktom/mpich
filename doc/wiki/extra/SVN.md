This page contains historical information about our SVN server. We now
use [Git](Git "wikilink") instead.

The SVN URL for the original MPICH2 trunk was:
<https://svn.mcs.anl.gov/repos/mpi/mpich2/trunk>. In place of `trunk`,
there were `branches` and <code>tags<code>. Within those two directories
there were also two subdirectories, `dev` and `release`. Particular
branches and tags were subdirectories of these.

The repository is still operational, however almost all paths have been
marked read-only.
