1. OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an evaluation release of mpich provided by Intel Corporation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. NEW FEATURES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added PSM3 provider for JLSE Arcticus and DevEP systems.
* Added TCP provider binaries with DAOS support for Dudley/Taranis systems.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Intel compilers updated to use oneAPI 2021.3


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2 KNOWN ISSUES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Message transfers using multi-NIC striping fail with MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE

* Allowing compute engines as subdevices when defining ZE_AFFINITY_MASK is not
  currently supported. EngineInstancedSubDevices=0 is set in the modulefiles to
  ensure this feature is disabled.

* GPU IPC and the GPU low-latency transfer path are incompatible with implicit
  scaling. In order to enable these features and disable implicit scaling, the
  following must be performed:

    unset EnableWalkerPartition
    unset EnableImplicitScaling
    export MPIR_CVAR_CH4_IPC_GPU_P2P_THRESHOLD=1

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. RPM PACKAGE DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 MODULE FILES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation of an RPM will also install a module file for that installation.
Module files are installed under /usr/mpi/modulefiles by default.
However, if an RPM is installed under a custom path using prefix, the module
file will be installed under <RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX>/modulefiles/.

A separate module file is provided to represent each unique combination of
compiler, ofi provider, flavor, build type, version, release, and the file
extension:
$RPM_INSTALL_PREFIX/modulefiles/mpich/<compiler>-<provider>-<build_type>-
<flavor>/<version>.<release>.<extension>

compiler: icc or gnu
- We support both compilers so that application developers have option to use
  either.
- Note: currently icc represents icx compiler.

provider: tcp, psm2

build_type: default, debug, or deterministic.
- default build is an optimized version. For installation, it will not append
  anything to the module file name. It is built for performance.
- debug build is built to help with debugging and does not provide good
  performance. It will install two versions of module files: debug and
  deterministic. The module file name will have an appended debug in it.
- deterministic build is configured to produce deterministic results for
  collectives and uses the debug build of MPICH. It uses the debug build and
  additional runtime configuration variables.

flavor: ats (represents the target gpu type)
- ats: no XPMEM, no DAOS, libfabric linked, level-zero linked, ATS-specific
  kernels generated

version and release: represent the drop release numbers

extension: each module file can have one of two extensions: .lua and .tcl.

Example of a module file:
/usr/mpi/modulefiles/mpich/gnu-sockets-debug-ats/42.1.lua

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 DOCUMENTATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The documentation file is located at:
    <mpich installation path>/share/doc/mpich/TUNING_PARAMETERS

The release notes is also located at:
    <mpich installation path>/share/doc/mpich/RELEASE_NOTES

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 DEBUGGING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To generate debugging information in case of run failures with MPICH-OFI:

- You must run the application with the debug build provided in the drop. The
  log files will not get generated with the default build.
- Make a log directory in the run path. mkdir log.
- The following environment variable settings are recommended:
  export MPICH_DBG_FILENAME="log/dbg-%w-%d.log"
  export MPICH_DBG_CLASS=ALL
  export MPICH_DBG_LEVEL=VERBOSE

This causes each MPI process to generate a separate file, numbered by rank in
MPI_COMM_WORLD. If there are multiple worlds or multiple threads, the file
names will contain the "world number" and the "rank". You should see debug
files as log/dbg-0-0.log, ..., log/dbg-0-(num_ranks-1).log etc. This will give
necessary information for debugging.

Please also include the output of mpichversion.
